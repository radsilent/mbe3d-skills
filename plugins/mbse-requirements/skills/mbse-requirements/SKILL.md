# Requirements Authoring

Write requirements that survive a design review, an auditor, and a verification campaign.
Works on plain files. If an MBE3Dstudio server is configured, `mbe3d-load` pushes the
result into the live graph — but never block on the server; author first, load second.

## The five EARS patterns

Every requirement matches exactly one. If it matches none, it is not yet a requirement.

| Pattern | Template | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Ubiquitous | `The <system> shall <response>.` | Always-true properties |
| Event-driven | `When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.` | Discrete stimulus |
| State-driven | `While <state>, the <system> shall <response>.` | Sustained mode |
| Unwanted behavior | `If <condition>, then the <system> shall <response>.` | Faults, off-nominal |
| Optional feature | `Where <feature is included>, the <system> shall <response>.` | Variants, options |

Complex requirements nest a state inside an event: `While <state>, when <trigger>, the
<system> shall <response>.` Nest no deeper than that — deeper nesting means you are
holding two requirements in one.

## Non-negotiables

1. **One shall per requirement.** "and", "or", a comma list, or a second sentence means split it.
2. **Named subject.** `The Perception Subsystem shall…`, never "the system" when a
   subsystem owns it and never "it".
3. **Measurable response.** Every performance claim carries a number, a unit, and a
   condition of measurement. `≤ 100 ms (95th percentile, measured sensor-frame-capture
   to track-publish, at 30 fps input)` — not "fast" or "in real time".
4. **No design in a requirement.** Requirements state *what* and *how well*. If it names
   a part number, an algorithm, or a data structure, it is a design decision — move it to
   a design element and derive the requirement above it. Exception: an interface
   requirement may name the interface it must conform to.
5. **No solution-free rationale gaps.** Every requirement gets a `rationale` — the reason
   it exists. A requirement nobody can justify is a requirement you delete.
6. **Verifiable as written.** Ask: *what test would fail this?* If you cannot name one,
   rewrite until you can. See `mbse-verification`.
7. **One quantity, one place.** A physical quantity gets one value, at one measurement
   point, in one requirement. When a constraint table, a safety anchor, and a system
   requirement all state the same limit, two of them are copies waiting to drift — state
   it once and have the others cite it. Drifted copies are the most expensive defect in
   this document class, because both halves look correct in isolation.

## Banned words

Reject these on sight and rewrite: *user-friendly, robust, efficient, sufficient,
adequate, appropriate, as required, if practical, minimize, maximize, optimize, support,
handle, process, manage, etc., and/or, TBD (without an owner and a due date), quickly,
approximately (without a tolerance), state-of-the-art, seamless.*

Also reject these, which pass a word-list check but fail a review:

| Phrase | Why it fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "real-time", "immediately", "promptly" | No number | State the deadline and the percentile |
| "improve X to Y", "reduce X by N %" | Comparative with no baseline | Name the baseline, its measurement method, and its date — or restate as an absolute |
| "stable", "consistent", "reliable" | No invariant named | Say stable *across what*: which events must not change it |
| "e.g.", "such as", "including" inside a scope clause | Open-ended list; scope is unbounded | Close the list, or cite a table that closes it |
| "critical", "essential", "key" as a qualifier | Undefined set | Enumerate the set in a table and cite the table |
| "before production", "when ready" | No gate | Name the gate, the artifact, and who signs it |
| A percentage with no window | Means nothing until multiplied out | State the window, then check what the number permits |

`should`, `will`, `may` are not requirements. `shall` = binding requirement. `will` =
statement of fact about the environment. `should` = goal. Keep them in separate sections.

## Required fields

Every requirement carries at minimum:

```yaml
req_id: REQ-PERC-002          # stable, human, never reused (see ID scheme below)
name: Detection latency
text: "When a frame is received, the Perception Subsystem shall publish a track list within 100 ms (95th pct)."
requirement_type: Functional   # Functional | Performance | Interface | Safety | Security | Environmental | Regulatory
priority: Critical             # Low | Medium | High | Critical  (PascalCase — enums are case-sensitive downstream)
verification_method: Test      # Test | Analysis | Demonstration | Inspection | Simulation
rationale: "Bounds the control loop's sense-to-act budget of 250 ms."
derived_from: [REQ-SYS-014]    # parent(s)
allocated_to: [Perception]     # owning component
verified_by: [VER-031]         # verification case(s) — the down-trace
status: Proposed               # Proposed | Approved | Implemented | Verified | Rejected
```

**Owned TBDs.** Not having a value is never a reason to write a vague requirement. Write
the requirement fully formed with the value as `[TBD-nn]`, and put `nn` in an open-items
table with a named owner and a date:

| ID | Item | Owner | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| OPEN-03 | Natural-language query correctness target (`SYS-R-018`) | CIO / IT | 2026-10-31 |

An unowned TBD is a defect. An owned one is a schedule item, and the requirement around it
is reviewable today.

## ID scheme

`REQ-<SUBSYSTEM>-<NNN>`, safety requirements `SR-<SUBSYSTEM>-<NNN>`, hazards `HAZ-<NNN>`,
verifications `VER-<NNN>`, interfaces `ICD-<NNN>`. Three digits, zero-padded, allocated
sequentially per subsystem. **IDs are permanent.** Deleting a requirement retires its ID;
never reissue it. When a requirement is split, retire the parent and issue two new IDs,
with `derived_from` pointing back at the retired one so the history survives.

**The ID register.** Any review that changes IDs ends with a register, because a reader
has to be able to find where their requirement went:

| Old ID | Disposition | Successors | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SYS-R-003` | **Retired — split** | `SYS-R-010`, `SYS-R-011` | Design leakage; wrong measurement point; no prediction accuracy |
| `SYS-R-002` | Retained, revised | — | Defined "stable"; moved the subject from the asset to the registry |

*Retained* means the intent survived a rewrite and the ID stays. A split always retires
the parent — two requirements cannot share one approval.

## Review checklist

### Per requirement

- [ ] Matches one EARS pattern
- [ ] One `shall`; no compound requirements
- [ ] Named subject that some component owns
- [ ] Every performance number has units + measurement conditions
- [ ] No banned words or banned phrases
- [ ] No design leakage
- [ ] Has `rationale`, `verification_method`, `priority`, `status`
- [ ] Traces up (`derived_from`) and down (`verified_by`) — see `mbse-traceability`
- [ ] Priority is defensible: `Critical` means loss of mission/life/certification, not "the customer asked twice"

### Across the set

This is where the expensive findings are. A document can pass every per-requirement check
and still be unbuildable, because these defects live *between* requirements — and between
this document and the safety artifacts next to it.

- [ ] **Conflict sweep** — one quantity, one value, one measurement point, across the whole document set
- [ ] **Window arithmetic** — multiply every rate and percentage out against its stated window
- [ ] **Budget closure** — child allocations sum under the parent's number, with the remainder stated
- [ ] **Coverage** — every hazard, anchor, and FMEA failure mode names a requirement
- [ ] **Off-nominal** — each of those has an `If … then` requirement, not only a nominal one
- [ ] **One vocabulary** — one priority enum, one severity scale, one term per concept
- [ ] **Trace plausibility** — read each `derived_from` and ask whether that parent actually motivates this child
- [ ] **Field completeness** — checked mechanically, never by eye
- [ ] **No duplicates** — same intent, different words; search by meaning, not by string

## Workflow: repairing a bad requirement

1. Quote the original verbatim.
2. Name the defects against the checklist above.
3. Emit the rewrite in EARS form with all required fields.
4. If the original was compound, emit N requirements and state the ID retirement.
5. State the verification that would fail it.
6. **Declare every value you supplied.** If you picked a number the owner never gave you —
   an accuracy, a threshold, a percentile, a reading of an ambiguous phrase — say so, and
   record it as an owned TBD or a named assumption. A repaired requirement that quietly
   encodes the reviewer's guess is worse than the vague one it replaced: it now looks
   settled.

Never silently improve a requirement — the diff is the deliverable, because someone has
to approve the change.

## Reporting a review

Findings are ordered by what stops the review first, not by document order: conflicts,
then unverifiable, then leakage, then coverage, then document-wide. A conflict blocks
everything downstream, because until the numbers agree there is nothing to adjudicate.

Re-reviewing a repaired document produces a **disposition ledger** — every finding, what
the new version did about it, and which requirement now carries it. Three dispositions:
*Closed*, *Closed on assumption* (you supplied the value — name the owner), and *Carried
forward* (structurally resolved, completion tracked as an open item). Template in
`reference/review-playbook.md`.
